# 🏥 Hospital Simulation

This project is a simulation of a hospital system built with **Python** and **Pygame**. It allows for the creation and control of movable characters who interact with various departments such as the reception, doctors, and the pharmacy.

## 🎮 Features

- Creation of interactive, movable characters.
- Object-oriented programming with **classes** for modular and maintainable code.
- Interaction with:
  - **Reception**: Patient registration.
  - **Doctors**: Assignment based on symptoms using a decision tree.
  - **Pharmacy**: Prescription dispensing and payment.
- Implementation of various data structures:
  - **Queues**: To manage lines at reception and pharmacy.
  - **Stacks** and **Lists**: For event handling and patient history.
  - **Dictionaries**: To store and retrieve data about patients and doctors.
  - **Tree**: For selecting the appropriate doctor based on symptoms.
